# NOBA API Reference

Base URL: `http://<host>:<port>` (default port 8080)

## Authentication

All endpoints except `/api/health` and `/api/login` require a valid session token.

Pass the token in either:
- **HTTP header:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Query parameter:** `?token=<token>` (required for SSE / EventSource)

Tokens are valid for 24 hours and expire automatically. A cleanup job runs every 5 minutes to purge expired tokens.

> **Full interactive API docs** are available at `/api/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/api/redoc` (ReDoc) when the server is running. This document covers the core endpoints — for the complete reference (300+ routes across 15 routers), use the interactive docs (disabled by default — set `NOBA_OPENAPI=1` to enable).

### `GET /api/stream`

Server-Sent Events stream — pushes a stats update every 5 seconds.

**Query parameters** (passed as query string, token required here):

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `token` | Session token |
| `services` | Comma-separated service names to monitor |
| `radarIps` | Comma-separated hosts to ping |
| `piholeUrl` | Pi-hole base URL |

## Error Codes

| HTTP Status | Meaning |

| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad request — invalid parameters |
| `401` | Not authenticated — missing or expired token |
| `403` | Forbidden — insufficient role |

| `409` | Conflict — resource already exists |
| `429` | Rate limited |

## Security Notes

- API keys for integrations (TrueNAS, Plex, etc.) are stored server-side in `config.yaml` and never sent to the browser. The frontend only receives sanitised metric payloads.
- Passwords are hashed with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (200,000 iterations) with a per-user random salt.
- Alert rule conditions use a safe regex-based parser — no `eval()` is used anywhere.
- The Content Security Policy (`default-src 'self'`) prevents XSS injection into the dashboard.
