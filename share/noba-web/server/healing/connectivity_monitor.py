"""Noba -- Site connectivity monitor.

Tracks which sites are 'connectivity-suspect' — meaning the server
cannot reach agents at that site. When a site is suspect, ALL healing
for targets at that site is suppressed to prevent false restarts.

State is in-memory only (like correlation state). Lost on restart,
which is acceptable — the next agent heartbeat cycle re-establishes
reachability within seconds.
