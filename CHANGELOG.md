# Changelog

All notable changes to NOBA Command Center are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Workflow group cancellation** — `JobRunner` now supports `cancel_group(automation_id)`, allowing the UI to terminate all active subprocesses associated with a parallel or sequential workflow run.
- **Collector health watchdog** — `BackgroundCollector` now tracks heartbeat pulses. The `/api/stats` and `/api/stream` endpoints report `collector_status: "stalled"` if background updates hang, enabling UI-level alerts.
- **556 new backend tests** — Auth router (136), automations router (137), integration drivers (178), healing modules (115), db/core (65). Total test count: 3,143.
- **21 new Vue sub-components** — Split 5 oversized views (AutomationsView, InfrastructureView, MonitoringView, LogsView, DashboardView) into focused tab components.
- **Backend constants module** (`server/constants.py`) — Centralized 16 magic numbers from routers and healing modules.
- **Frontend constants module** (`constants.js`) — Centralized 15 timing/limit values from stores and components.
- **14 CSS utility classes** — Table cell, border, spacing, and typography utilities replacing 208 inline style attributes.
- **`.dockerignore`** — Excludes `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `tests/`, `.venv` from Docker build context.
### Fixed
- **Memory progress bar** — Core System card now correctly displays memory percentage by falling back to the `memPercent` SSE field when the `memory` object is a pre-formatted string.
- **Hardware card empty** — CPU and GPU model names were missing because `hwCpu`/`hwGpu` keys weren't declared in the dashboard store's reactive object, causing SSE data to be silently dropped.
- **Agent "Last seen: --"** — SSE agent list now includes `last_seen_s` field, matching the REST API. Online agents now show "7s ago" instead of "--".
- **GPU model `<br>` literal** — Backend no longer injects HTML `<br>` into GPU model string; frontend uses `white-space: pre-line` for multi-GPU line breaks.
- **Pi-hole unauthorized state** — Pi-hole card now shows a clean "API Key Required" badge with a settings link instead of rendering broken empty metric boxes with raw JSON errors.
- **Tailscale "localhost" names** — Devices reporting `HostName: "localhost"` (Android/TV devices) now fall back to `DNSName` for proper identification (e.g., "samsung-sm-s938b", "google-tv-streamer-1").
- **Infrastructure Services tab empty** — Collector now reads `monitoredServices` from YAML config as fallback when SSE query params don't include the service list.
- **Healing approval timestamps** — Approvals tab now correctly maps `requested_at` field from the API instead of the non-existent `ts` field. Also fixed column header "Trust" → "Trigger" and field mapping for `automation_id`.

### Improved
- **Dashboard integration cards** — Empty "No data available" integration cards are now collapsed into a single "N unconfigured integrations" button, drastically reducing scroll depth.
- **Log severity coloring** — System log viewer now color-codes lines: errors in red, warnings in yellow, debug dimmed — making critical issues immediately visible.
- **Healing table labels** — Effectiveness Summary table now shows human-friendly names (Total, Verified, Failed, Pending, Success Rate) instead of raw database column names.
- **Security score consistency** — Unified color thresholds across aggregate donut and per-agent badges (green ≥80, yellow ≥60, red <60).
- **Monitoring tab badges** — SLA, Incidents, and Endpoints tabs now show data count badges, indicating which tabs have content at a glance.
- **Infrastructure service map** — Service Map cards now display CPU/RAM/uptime health indicators when available from the collector.
- **Disk Health card** — Drive list is now collapsed by default with a "Show N drives" toggle, keeping the card compact while preserving detail on demand.
- **Theme renamed** — Default theme renamed from "Operator" to "Command" to avoid confusion with the authentication role of the same name.
- **Quick Links** — Renamed "Homelab Bookmarks/Links" to "Quick Links" across dashboard card, settings label, and visibility toggle to align with NOBA's production positioning.
- **Automation form validation** — Added frontend validation to the automation modal to ensure required fields (script paths, URLs, cron) are populated before submission.
- **Mobile horizontal tab bar** — Refactored navigation tabs to use a horizontally scrollable strip on small viewports, recovering vertical space and preventing button stacking.
- **Accessibility hardening** — Added `aria-label` attributes to multiple icon-only buttons, including the settings search clear and audit log pagination controls.
- **Infrastructure UI unification** — Migrated the Infrastructure view and Kubernetes browser to the `AppTabBar` component, ensuring consistent navigation and styling across all system views.
- **Modernized scaling interaction** — Replaced native browser `prompt()` with a non-blocking `AppModal` for Kubernetes deployment scaling, providing a safer and theme-consistent user experience.
- **Custom chart optimization** — Refactored the Custom Charts builder to use the `ChartWrapper` component, leveraging incremental update performance and reducing redundant code.
- **UI input standardization** — Swept the Traffic and Kubernetes tabs to replace inconsistent inline styles with global `.field-input` and `.field-select` utility classes.
- **Unified tab navigation** — Created a reusable `AppTabBar` component to standardize navigation across Logs, Monitoring, Healing, Infrastructure, and Settings views.
- **Interactive security feedback** — Added per-host scan status indicators in the Security view, providing immediate visual confirmation of dispatched scan requests.
- **Healing consistency** — Standardized trust promotion actions using the global `modals.confirm()` store and implemented actionable empty states for the healing ledger.
- **Workflow builder dirty guard** — Implemented an "unsaved changes" warning in the `WorkflowBuilder`. Users are now prompted before closing the modal if modifications were made to the graph, preventing accidental data loss.
- **Automation bulk action safety** — Standardized bulk actions (Enable, Disable, Delete) in the Automations view using the new Selection Bar pattern. Physically separates destructive actions from global navigation and filters.
- **Agent bulk action safety** — Moved bulk actions (Update, Remove) into a dedicated, visually distinct Selection Bar in the Agents view. Separates destructive actions from the "Select All" button to prevent accidental mass deletions.
- **Workflow canvas panning** — Implemented mouse-drag panning and a "Reset View" control in the `WorkflowBuilder`. Improves navigation for complex multi-node automation graphs.
- **Settings search/filter** — Added a real-time filter to the Settings view, allowing users to quickly locate specific integration or system categories among 11+ tabs.
- **Metric tooltips** — Added contextual hover hints to agent metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk) in the `AgentDetailModal`, providing immediate detail on current utilization and capacity.
- **Modal accessibility & UX** — Added global Escape key listener and body scroll locking to all modals. Prevents background scrolling and ensures consistent keyboard interaction.
- **Manual modal refresh** — Added a sync button to the `AgentDetailModal` header, allowing users to re-trigger data fetching for the active tab without re-opening the modal.
- **Enhanced command feedback** — Host output tabs in the Command Palette now display activity spinners while commands are in flight, providing clearer feedback for broadcast operations.
- **Form field standardization** — Refactored Maintenance Window forms to use global CSS classes, ensuring consistent styling and focus behavior across all management screens.
- **Reliable metrics rollups** — Refactored `rollup_to_1m` and `rollup_to_1h` to be gap-aware. Background tasks now automatically identify and fill missing historical data points after server outages or high-load delays.
...
- **Mobile header optimization** — Collapsed the search bar and status pills on mobile viewports to prevent overcrowding and ensure critical controls remain accessible.
- **Stalled collector awareness** — Added a warning banner to the header that appears if background data collection hangs, showing the time since the last successful refresh.
- **Unified confirmations** — Standardized all destructive actions (delete, wipe, bulk toggle) to use the global `modals.confirm()` store, replacing local dialog components and improving UI consistency.
- **Actionable empty states** — Refactored "No data" screens in Users and Integrations tabs to include direct call-to-action buttons for creating the first record.
- **Interactive log tailer polish** — Enhanced `LogStreamModal` with smart auto-scroll logic and a "New logs below" button that appears when scrolled up.
- **Plugin execution watchdog** — Implemented strict timeouts for plugin `collect()` and `render()` calls using `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Prevents misbehaving plugins from hanging background threads.
- **`_cleanup_transfers` resilience** — Added inner exception guards to the file transfer cleanup loop to prevent silent task death on transient I/O errors.
- **Unified integration error handling** — Standardized 40+ service integrations to differentiate between `ConfigError` (auth/URL) and `TransientError` (network/5xx). Detailed failure reasons are now propagated to the collector and UI.
- **`DriftChecker` async dispatch** — Fixed event loop anti-pattern by using `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` for WebSocket command delivery from background threads.
- **Frontend reactivity optimization** — Switched high-volume Pinia stores (`dashboard`, `healing`) to use `shallowRef` and `shallowReactive`, reducing CPU/memory overhead for large metric and log datasets.
- **`ChartWrapper` performance** — Refactored to use incremental updates via `chart.update()` instead of full instance recreation on every data change.
- **`api_agent_report()` refactored** — 173-line blob handler decomposed into 10 focused helpers; WebSocket handlers also split. Shared helpers between HTTP and WS paths.
- **Dockerfile hardened** — Added `SHELL` directive for `bash -euo pipefail`, OCI metadata labels, pinned pip versions from pyproject.toml.
- **Shell script portability** — Hardcoded `/tmp` paths replaced with `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` across 6 scripts (24 replacements). Log libraries consolidated into `noba-lib.sh` with portable `printf` (no `echo -e`).
- **Return type hints** — Added to 11 router functions across 6 files.
- **Accessibility** — 8 fixes: clickable divs get `role="button"` + keyboard handlers, icon-only buttons get `aria-label`.
- **Dependency sync** — `requirements.txt` now includes `websocket-client>=1.7` matching pyproject.toml.

### Fixed
- **`linked_providers` read-connection crash** — `get_linked_providers()` called `CREATE TABLE` via the read-only connection, causing `OperationalError: attempt to write a readonly database`. Table now created during schema init; read functions handle missing table gracefully.
- **IntegrationsTab broken HTML** — 4 social provider `<div>` tags missing closing `>` brackets, causing build failures.
- **3 `console.error` calls** left in production Vue code (LogsView, LogStreamModal, CommandPalette) — removed.

### Added (continued)
- **Bulk Agent Management** — Selection system for agent cards with bulk update (self-update) and bulk remove capabilities.
- **Bulk Automation Management** — Multi-select for automations with bulk enable, disable, and delete actions.
- **Terminal Fullscreen Mode** — Added a maximize toggle to the Terminal modal and `Alt+Enter` keyboard shortcut for better visibility of dense command outputs.
- **Log Stream Flow Control** — Added Pause/Resume functionality to the live log stream and a floating "Jump to Bottom" indicator that appears when new logs arrive while auto-scroll is disabled.
- **Trust state initialization** — `PUT /api/healing/trust/{rule_id}` endpoint to seed trust states directly. Previously only promote/demote existed, requiring a pre-existing state.
- **IaC export auto-discovery** — `?discover=true` query parameter on all 3 export endpoints (Ansible, Docker Compose, shell script). Dispatches `discover_services` + `container_list` to the target agent, waits for WebSocket results, and merges into agent data before generating output. Warnings returned via `X-Noba-Discovery-Warning` header.
- **Remote agent healing** — Healing executor now dispatches actions to remote agents via WebSocket when the alert rule specifies a `target` hostname. Maps `restart_container` → `container_control` and `restart_service` → agent commands. Falls back to local execution if target is not an online agent.
- **First-run onboarding** — New users see a guided setup checklist instead of an unconfigured dashboard. Steps: Core Monitoring (auto-complete), Connect Services (integration wizard modal), Set Up Notifications (channel picker modal), Deploy Agents (deploy modal), Add Users (user creation modal). Progress tracked with checkmarks. Dismissible with "Continue to Dashboard".
- **Docker update flow** — Update check detects Docker containers and shows pull/recreate instructions instead of the bare-metal apply button. GHCR workflow publishes images on push to main and tags.
- **Zero CDN dependencies** — Font Awesome, Chakra Petch, and JetBrains Mono are now bundled locally via npm. No external requests needed — works fully offline and fixes font/icon rendering issues in Docker.
- **Self-update system** — Check for updates and apply them from the UI (Settings → General). Backend: `GET /api/system/update/check` compares local version to remote via git, `POST /api/system/update/apply` pulls, rebuilds frontend, re-installs, and restarts the service.
- Agent v2.1.0 with new commands: `security_scan`, `network_discover`, `discover_services`, `follow_logs`, `stop_stream`, `get_stream`, `endpoint_check`, `verify_backup`, `dns_lookup`, `network_config`, `network_stats`
- Risk-tiered command authorization (low/medium/high) with role-based permissions
- Agent capability registry with version-aware command validation
- Parameter validation for all 32+ command types with regex, length, and denylist checks
- Agent registry SQLite table for persistence across server restarts
- Bulk command support (send to multiple agents at once)
- Command history persistence in SQLite with status tracking

### Improved
- **Dashboard Layout Persistence** — Reordered cards are now saved to backend user preferences using SortableJS `store` sync. Layouts persist across different browsers and devices.
- **Keyboard-First Command Palette** — Enhanced `Ctrl+K` search with full keyboard navigation (ArrowUp/Down to highlight, Enter to select).
- **Global Dialog Accessibility** — Implemented `Enter` key listener for all global confirmation dialogs to streamline destructive workflows.
- **Persistent Sidebar State** — Manual sidebar collapse/expand states are now synced to user preferences and restored on login.
- **Log Stream Stability** — Optimized line buffering logic to prevent memory bloat during high-volume log ingest.
- **SQLite read/write lock separation** — Read operations now use a separate connection with its own lock, allowing concurrent reads under WAL mode without blocking writers. Write operations keep the existing exclusive lock. ~60 read-only methods switched to the read path. `PRAGMA query_only=ON` on the read connection prevents accidental writes.
- **Linked providers persisted to DB** — Social login account links (Google, GitHub, etc.) are now stored in a `linked_providers` table instead of an in-memory dict. Links survive service restarts.
- **Credential encryption at rest** — Integration secrets in `config.yaml` (passwords, tokens, API keys) are now encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption. Master key stored separately at `~/.config/noba/.master.key` (mode 0600). Existing plaintext configs are transparently encrypted on next save. `cryptography` added as a required dependency.
- **Agent sidebar badge** — Now shows `online/total` count instead of hiding when all agents are offline. Warning color when some are down.
- **API failure visibility** — Header shows a banner when background API requests are silently failing, with failure count and last error. Prevents the "everything looks fine but nothing is updating" trap.
- **Setup wizard reset** — "Re-run Setup Wizard" button in Settings → General clears the welcome dismissal so onboarding can be re-triggered.
- **Integration card empty states** — "configure in Settings" messages are now clickable links that navigate directly to the Integrations settings tab.
- **Maintenance badge clickable** — Header maintenance window indicator now navigates to Settings → Maintenance on click.
- **Theme-safe colors** — WorkflowBuilder node type colors and RunOutput console now use CSS theme variables instead of hardcoded hex values.
- Agent reports now trigger persistence on every report cycle (not just on command completion)

### Security
- **CLI command hardening** — Hardened `cmd_run` and `cmd_exec` in `noba-cli.sh` against JSON injection by switching to native Python encoding for all POST request bodies.
- **Database foreign key enforcement** — Enabled `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` for all database connections. Ensures relational integrity and prevents orphaned records in the audit and healing trails.
- **API input validation hardened** — Eliminated 18 bare `int()` casts on query parameters across the backend routers. Standardized on `_safe_int` and `_int_param` helpers to prevent unhandled 500 errors on invalid user input.
- **Plugin read-only enforcement** — Refactored `PluginContext.query()` to use the dedicated read-only database connection and lock. Strictly prevents write operations (DELETE/DROP) via the plugin API.
- **Thread-safe process creation** — Replaced unsafe `preexec_fn=os.setsid` with `start_new_session=True` in terminal and agent PTY handlers to prevent deadlocks in multi-threaded environments.
- **Shell CLI injection fix** — Hardened `noba-cli.sh` against Python code injection in `_json_val` and JSON breakage in `cmd_login`. Switched to `sys.argv` and native JSON encoding for payloads.
- **`_safe_remove` path traversal hardening** — Added directory separator termination to prefix checks to prevent sibling directory bypass in file deletion helpers.
- **SSRF via redirect** — Shared httpx client now uses `follow_redirects=False` to prevent integration endpoints from being redirected to internal/cloud metadata IPs.
- **Webhook DNS rebinding** — `_is_safe_webhook_url()` now resolves hostnames via `socket.getaddrinfo()` and checks all resulting IPs against private/loopback/link-local ranges. Previously only checked string-based IP parsing.
- **Run command argument validation** — `_handle_run` now validates all arguments after the allowed prefix against `[a-zA-Z0-9@._/:-]` to prevent abuse of the allowlisted command prefixes.
- **OpenAPI docs disabled by default** — `/api/docs`, `/api/redoc`, and `/api/openapi.json` are now hidden unless `NOBA_DEV=1` is set, preventing API schema disclosure to unauthenticated users.
- **CSP tightened** — Removed `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` from `script-src`, stripped all external CDN allowances (fonts/icons already bundled). Service worker registration moved from inline script to the main JS bundle.
- **TLS verification configurable** — All integration HTTP calls (K8s, Proxmox, UniFi, UniFi Protect) now respect per-integration `verifySsl` settings instead of hardcoded `verify=False`. Integration instances have a `verify_ssl` DB column and UI checkbox. Supports CA bundle file paths for custom certificates.
- **Script automation shell escalation blocked** — Automations with custom `command` fields now require admin role, preventing operator→shell privilege escalation.
- **Automation variable injection blocked** — Operator-supplied variables substituted into `command` strings via `format_map` are now sanitized with `shlex.quote()`, preventing shell metacharacter injection.
- **Agent key timing attack mitigated** — Agent key validation now uses `secrets.compare_digest` for constant-time comparison.
- **Prometheus label injection prevented** — Service names and mount points in `/api/prometheus` metrics are now escaped per the exposition format spec.
- **OAuth2/OIDC CSRF protection** — All social login and OIDC flows now generate and validate a cryptographic `state` parameter, preventing login CSRF attacks.
- **OAuth token leak fixed** — Account linking no longer passes the NOBA session token as the OAuth `state` parameter. Tokens are stored server-side with a random nonce.
- **Healing `run` action restricted** — Command execution via the healing pipeline is now restricted to an allowlist of safe prefixes (systemctl, docker, podman, restic, rclone, certbot).
- **API key expiry enforced** — Expired API keys are now rejected at authentication time.
- **Webhook SSRF protection** — Remediation webhook handler blocks requests to private networks, loopback, link-local, reserved ranges, and cloud metadata endpoints.
- **SSRF DNS resolution validation** — Integration instance URL validation now resolves hostnames and checks resolved IPs against private ranges.
- **LDAP filter injection fix** — Username escaping now uses proper RFC 4515 encoding instead of partial character replacement.
- **Terminal audit logging** — PTY sessions now log start/end events with user, role, IP, and duration to the audit trail.
- **SSH key validation** — Rejects authorized_keys entries with embedded options (`command=`, `from=`, etc.).
- **SQL column allowlist** — Integration instance updates validate field names against an explicit allowlist.
- **HTTPException guards** — Added `except HTTPException: raise` across all routers to prevent HTTP errors from being swallowed as 500s.
- **Journal regex validation** — Grep patterns are pre-validated with `re.compile()` before passing to `journalctl`.
- **Auth level corrections** — TOTP setup upgraded to operator, stream-logs downgraded from admin to operator, update check upgraded to operator, social link endpoint validates tokens.
- **Async event loop safety** — 20+ `subprocess.run()` calls in async routes wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` to prevent blocking the event loop.

### Fixed
- **Alert condition validation** — Malformed conditions (bare operators, missing thresholds, garbage strings) are now rejected at creation time with clear error messages. Validation applied to create, update, and batch save endpoints.
- **Heal action params double-nesting** — Legacy single-action alert rules were wrapping params inside an extra `params` key, causing heal execution to fail after approval. Fixed chain wrapper to extract params correctly.
- **Graylog user/password auth** — Graylog search integration now supports both API token (`token:token`) and user/password (`user:password`) Basic auth. Added `X-Requested-By: noba` header required by Graylog v7+. New settings: `graylogUser`, `graylogPassword`.
- **Agent capability fallback for newer versions** — Agents reporting a version not explicitly in the capability registry fell back to the v1.1.0 baseline. Now any agent ≥ v2.0.0 gets full v2 capabilities automatically.
- **Endpoint monitor self-referential deadlock** — Monitors targeting the same NOBA instance deadlocked the uvicorn process. Now detects self-referential URLs and returns `skipped` status.
- **Healing dry-run ignores maintenance windows** — The `/api/healing/dry-run` endpoint did not check active maintenance windows. Now queries the maintenance manager before simulation.
- **Proxmox API token double-prefix** — Detected full token IDs and uses them directly.
- **Healing effectiveness always 0%** — Endpoint queried non-existent `outcome` field; now uses `verified`/`action_success`.
- **Circuit breaker never tripped** — Query limit equalled threshold (3). Now looks back 50 entries.
- **LedgerTimeline timestamps** — Unix seconds passed to `new Date()` without ×1000.
- **Expired tokens accepted from DB** — Token fallback path promoted expired tokens to memory without checking expiry.
- **Double JSON encoding** — `evidence` field in health trigger suggestions was pre-serialized then re-serialized.
- **Dict passed as string** — Canary dry-run passed a dict to `suggested_action`.
- **`total_agents` NameError** — Variable undefined if monitoring coverage section threw.
- **Rollback bypassed DB write lock** — Used raw `_get_conn()` outside lock.
- **Dead code in `get_heal_outcomes`** — Redundant LIMIT 0 query + double lock acquire removed.
- **`_active_alerts` leak** — Targets added during suppressed paths stayed in the set forever. Split into TTL-based `_active_alerts` and `_active_heals` set.
- **Alert rules save was a no-op** — "Save Rules" in Settings sent the wrong payload. Added `PUT /api/alert-rules` batch endpoint.
- **Uptime card always showed 0%** — Backend now computes and returns percent.
- **Expired token crash** — DB fallback returned bare `None` instead of `(None, None)`.
- **Agent policy version always 0** — Now uses a SHA-256 content hash.
- **DNS flush hardcoded `pihole-FTL`** — Now reads `dnsService` from config.
- **Health score trigger** — Scheduler was passing Database object instead of health score categories.
- **Masonry grid after welcome dismiss** — Re-initializes ResizeObserver.
- **Self-update install step** — Added `--skip-deps` and `--no-restart` to install.sh invocation.
- **Trust level naming** — Fixed `"suggest"` to `"approve"` in `db/healing.py` trust level constants.
