# Changelog

All notable changes to NOBA Command Center are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Agent WebSocket result type collision** — Commands sent via WebSocket stayed permanently "queued" because the agent's result message overwrote `{"type": "result"}` with `{"type": "disk_usage"}` during dict unpacking. Agent now sends command type in a separate `cmd` field.
- **Server backward compatibility** — Server now detects old-format agent results (pre-v2.1.0) and reshapes them automatically, so mixed-version deployments work correctly.
- **Command palette scope error** — `runPaletteCommand()` referenced `CMD_CATALOG` as a closure variable instead of `this.CMD_CATALOG`, causing ReferenceError in the mixin scope. Also wrapped in try/finally so the "Sending..." state always clears.
- **Dashboard layout corruption on page navigation** — `initMasonry()` leaked ResizeObservers (never disconnected old ones) and observed ALL `.card` elements globally instead of scoping to the dashboard grid. Navigating from Security to Dashboard caused a large blank area at the top. Fixed by disconnecting old observer, scoping to `#sortable-grid`, and using `offsetParent` for visibility checks.
- **Stacking setInterval in dashboard cards** — System Health and Uptime Status cards used bare `setInterval` in `x-init` without guards. Added re-entry prevention.
- **Database agent methods using raw connection** — `upsert_agent`, `get_all_agents`, `delete_agent`, `update_agent_config` in `db/core.py` used `self._conn` directly instead of `self._get_conn()`, risking NoneType errors if the connection wasn't initialized.
- **Logger shadow in system.py** — Module-level `logger` was reassigned to `"noba.agent.ws"` at line 1178, silently changing the logger for all routes below that point. Renamed to `_ws_logger`.
- **WebSocket stream data memory leak** — Stream messages appended to `_agent_cmd_results` without any size cap. Added 500-entry limit matching existing patterns.
- **HTML null guards** — Added optional chaining for `disk.attributes.*` SMART fields, null guard on `zfs.pools` iteration, and `typeof Chart` guard in `renderMultiChart()`.

### Changed
- **Troubleshooting docs** — Added 3 new sections: agent commands stuck in queued, dashboard layout corruption, and stale browser cache after updates.
- **`.gitignore`** — Added `.claude/worktrees/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/` to prevent local tooling state from being committed.
